                    Hey, have you tried Litehost lately?

                    Litehost is my side project which is a shared
                    hosting platform with <b>PHP & Laravel</b> developers in mind. It has <b>Composer, Git & PHP CLI</b>
                    pre-installed on its
                    servers. SSH access is also granted on request. Litehost is pretty affordable.
